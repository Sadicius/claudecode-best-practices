## Setup and Configuration

### Essential CLAUDE.md Files

Create `CLAUDE.md` files as your primary context mechanism. These should include:

- **Common bash commands** (build, test, lint)
- **Code style guidelines** and naming conventions
- **Testing instructions** and framework preferences
- **Repository etiquette** (branch naming, merge vs rebase)
- **Developer environment setup** requirements
- **Project-specific warnings** and gotchas

**Best Practice**: Keep CLAUDE.md files concise, human-readable, and actively maintained. Use the `#` key to add content during sessions.

### Permission Management

Configure tool allowlists strategically:

- Start conservative, expand based on trust
- Use `/permissions` command for session management
- Consider `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for contained environments only
- Share team allowlists via `.claude/settings.json` in version control

### Multi-Repository Workflows

**Two-Clone Strategy**: Maintain separate repository clones with different VS Code profiles for parallel work streams. This enables:

- Independent Claude sessions on different features
- Visual workspace differentiation (themes, layouts)
- Simplified branch management per task

## Workflow Patterns

### 1. Explore, Plan, Code, Commit

The foundational workflow for complex tasks:

1. **Exploration Phase**
   - Ask Claude to read relevant files without writing code
   - Use subagents for complex investigations
   - Gather comprehensive context before planning

2. **Planning Phase**
   - Use "think" keywords to trigger extended reasoning
   - Create documented plans in GitHub issues or markdown files
   - Validate plans before implementation

3. **Implementation Phase**
   - Break into incremental, testable changes
   - Verify solutions during implementation
   - Maintain focus on the documented plan

4. **Commit Phase**
   - Generate contextual commit messages
   - Update documentation and changelogs
   - Create pull requests with comprehensive descriptions

### 2. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Particularly powerful with AI assistance:

1. **Write failing tests** based on expected behavior
2. **Verify tests fail** before implementation
3. **Commit tests** when satisfied with coverage
4. **Implement to pass tests** without modifying test cases
5. **Use independent verification** to avoid overfitting

### 3. Visual Iteration Workflow

For UI/UX development:

1. **Provide visual mockups** (screenshots, designs)
2. **Enable screenshot capabilities** (Puppeteer MCP, simulators)
3. **Implement and screenshot iteratively**
4. **Refine through visual comparison**

### 4. Living Documentation Approach

Transform plans into living documents:

- **Create implementation plans** as markdown files
- **Update plans during development** as new insights emerge
- **Treat plan updates** as quality checkpoints
- **Use plans for context** when resuming work in new sessions

## Project Management

### Task Breakdown and Tracking

**Use TodoWrite extensively** for:

- Complex multi-step tasks (3+ distinct steps)
- Multiple user requirements
- Progress visibility and tracking
- Context management across sessions

**Key Principles**:

- Only one task "in_progress" at a time
- Mark tasks complete immediately upon finishing
- Break large tasks into specific, actionable items
- Remove irrelevant tasks promptly

### Context Management

- Use `/clear` frequently between distinct tasks
- Maintain focused context windows
- Reset conversations when context becomes noisy
- Preserve important context in CLAUDE.md files

### Multi-Session Continuity

Enable seamless work resumption through:

- Up-to-date plan documents
- Comprehensive CLAUDE.md context
- Clear task status tracking
- Documented architectural decisions

## Code Quality and Testing

### Code Standards Enforcement

Implement systematic quality gates:

```markdown
## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Code follows project conventions  
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] No linter/formatter warnings
- [ ] Clear commit messages
- [ ] Implementation matches plan
- [ ] No unresolved TODOs
```

### Testing Best Practices

- **Test behavior, not implementation**
- **One assertion per test** when possible
- **Clear test names** describing scenarios
- **Use existing test utilities** and helpers
- **Ensure deterministic tests**
- **Prefer integration over heavy mocking**

### Iterative Code Review

Use built-in review capabilities:

- Ask Claude to review its own code
- Request specific focus areas (security, performance, maintainability)
- Verify adherence to project patterns
- Check for edge cases and error handling

## Architecture and Tool Design

### Simplicity-First Architecture

**Key Principle**: Maintain single main loop with maximum one branch for subtasks.

- Avoid multi-agent complexity
- Use subagents sparingly and purposefully  
- Keep control flow debuggable and traceable
- Resist over-engineering temptations

### Effective Tool Design

Balance tool granularity based on usage frequency:

- **Low-level tools** (Bash, Read, Write) for flexibility
- **Medium-level tools** (Edit, Grep, Glob) for common operations
- **High-level tools** (WebFetch, Task) for complex workflows

**Design Principle**: More frequent usage ‚Üí more specialized tooling

### Search Strategy

**Prefer LLM-based search over RAG**:

- Use sophisticated regex and ripgrep commands
- Let Claude understand code structure naturally
- Avoid hidden failure modes of embedding-based search
- Enable RL learning in search patterns

## Advanced Techniques

### Parallel Development

**Git Worktrees Method**:

```bash
# Create separate worktrees for parallel development
git worktree add ../project-feature-a feature-a
git worktree add ../project-feature-b feature-b

# Run Claude in each worktree independently
cd ../project-feature-a && claude
```

**Benefits**:

- Independent task execution
- Isolated file changes
- Shared git history
- Simplified merge management

### Headless Automation

Use headless mode (`claude -p`) for:

- **CI/CD integration** and automated workflows
- **Issue triage** and labeling systems
- **Code review** automation
- **Large-scale migrations** and refactoring

**Patterns**:

1. **Fan-out processing**: Generate task lists, process in parallel
2. **Pipeline integration**: Chain with existing data processing

### Multi-Claude Workflows

**Separation of Concerns**:

- One Claude writes code, another reviews
- Separate contexts for different perspectives
- Communication through shared workspaces
- Independent validation and verification

## Real-World Applications
